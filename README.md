# dsp

**dsp** is a peerâ€“peer communication protocol.

Every node is given a fingerprint based on a unique public key.  Every node keeps a finite local list of valid nodes, identified by their fingerprint.  The list is arranged as a series of buckets, the number of bits in the fingerprint determining the number of buckets (i.e. 256 buckets for the SHA256 hash).  Each bucket is of equal, finite (configurable) length, and valid node-fingerprints are queued into buckets in an LRU fashion (the least recently-contacted node being removed from a full bucket when a new node is found).  The buckets are numbered such that a given node matching the first `n` bits of its fingerprint with that of the host is placed into bucket (`n - # of buckets`).  Hence the arithmetic difference between fingerprints is considered to be the "distance" between nodes, and the host preferentially remembers valid nodes close by.  It should be noted that this means the first bucket is always empty (as it equals the host's fingerprint).

### Security

Nodes are verified by requesting their (signed) public key, and comparing its hash to the given fingerprint.  To find a particular node not yet known to the host, a request is sent to the known nodes closest to the node to be found.  These requests traverse through the network until the node is found.

## Structure

A given instance has the following file structure:

    /
        keys/
            private
            public
        nodes/
        authorized
        blacklist
        config

## Manual

**NAME**

    dsp

**SYNOPSIS**

    dsp [option [...]]

**DESCRIPTION**

    dsp instantiates a dsp node, or retrieves data and sends commands if an instance already exists (using the DSP_ADDRESS environment variable).

**OPTIONS**

    -h, --help
        Display this help and exit.

    -i, --initialize [<directory>]
        Initialize a new dsp node, returning the fingerprint.

    -c, --config [option [...]]
        Reads config from stdin, although specified options take precedence.

        bootstrap=<fingerprint>
            A bootstrap node provides routes to peers to populate an empty nodes list.
